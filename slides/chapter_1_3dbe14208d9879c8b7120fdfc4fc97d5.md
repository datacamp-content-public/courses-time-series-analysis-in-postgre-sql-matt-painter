title: Removal of Outliers from Historical Data


`@script`
In the previous exercise we talked about multiple ways to identify outliers in your historical data.  Having even a single outlier in your historical data can drastically alter the future forecast.

## Outliers within your historical data

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "cccb361ba6"
```

`@part1`



`@script`
If we know which data points should be removed from the data set, you can replace it with a value that will not significantly alter the historical trend.  There may be times that you want to simply average the values from before and after the event and other times you may prefer to take the data point pre or post that is closest to the outlier.  The augmentation that you chose will be heavily dependent on the calculation you are using.  For instance if you are using an average calculation, you will likely chose the midpoint between the pre and post data points.  If you are using a median function, you may take one of the nearby data points to just push the median one closer to the outlier.

## Final Slide

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "c4016a16c0"
```

`@script`
For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to find the data point from one week prior to the outlier and one week after the outlier, average the two and replace the outlier with this new data point.
